This document defines a way to represent fractional seconds in iCalendar.

[NOTE,title=Open Issues]
====
Recurrences:: It is probably the case that subsecond intervals are most useful for short
recurrence intervals. Neither JSCalendar nor iCalendar currently allows that.

This probably only requires that the interval value be allowed to contain fractional values (for
seconds frequency only?).
