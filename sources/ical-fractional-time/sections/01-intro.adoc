== Introduction

There has been an expressed need for the ability to use fractional seconds in iCalendar. With
the advent of JSCalendar there is a way to do so in that representation. This specification
provides a - partially backwards compatible - way to represent such times in iCalendar.

It is probable that applications needing fractional seconds require recurrence rules that use
sub-second intervals.

This specification also shows how values should be mapped to and from JSCalendar.
