This document specifies an extension to the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling
Core Object Specification (iCalendar) to support fractional time values. It
defines:

* The format for expressing fractional time values in iCalendar properties

* Rules for handling fractional time values in calendar operations

* Compatibility considerations with existing iCalendar implementations

This specification is designed to be backward compatible with existing iCalendar implementations
while providing enhanced precision where needed.
