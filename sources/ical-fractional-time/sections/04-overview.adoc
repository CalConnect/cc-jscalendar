=== Current iCalendar Time Format

The current iCalendar specification (<<RFC5545>>) defines time values with second-level
precision using the format "HHMMSS". While this format has served well for most calendar
applications, there are use cases that require greater precision.

=== Need for Fractional Time

Several scenarios require time precision beyond seconds:

* Scientific observations and measurements
* High-precision event scheduling
* Integration with external time-sensitive systems
* Precise synchronization between calendar systems

=== Proposed Extension

This specification extends the iCalendar time format to support fractional seconds using the
format "HHMMSS.fff", where:

* HH represents hours (00-23)
* MM represents minutes (00-59)
* SS represents seconds (00-60)
* .fff represents fractional seconds (1-3 decimal places)

This extension maintains backward compatibility while providing enhanced precision where
needed.
