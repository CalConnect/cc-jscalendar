=== Time Value Format

The fractional time extension adds support for decimal fractions in the time portion of
DATE-TIME values. The format follows this ABNF:

[source%unnumbered]
----
time-hour       = 2DIGIT        ; 00-23
time-minute     = 2DIGIT        ; 00-59
time-second     = 2DIGIT        ; 00-60
time-fraction   = 1*3DIGIT      ; 000-999
time-fractional = time-hour time-minute time-second "." time-fraction
----

=== Usage in Properties

The fractional time format MAY be used in any iCalendar property that accepts DATE-TIME
values. Examples include:

* DTSTART
* DTEND
* DUE
* CREATED
* LAST-MODIFIED

=== Examples

.Basic Usage
[source%unnumbered]
----
DTSTART:20250223T143059.500Z
----

This represents 14:30:59.5 UTC on February 23, 2025.

=== Implementation Requirements

==== Precision

Implementations MUST support fractional seconds with up to three decimal places (millisecond
precision). They MAY truncate or round any additional precision.

==== Compatibility

When interacting with implementations that do not support fractional time:

* Writers SHOULD round to the nearest second when generating traditional iCalendar data
* Readers MUST accept traditional iCalendar time values without fractions
* Readers SHOULD preserve fractional precision when present

==== Time Zone Considerations

Fractional time values work identically with both UTC ("Z" suffix) and local time with TZID
parameter. The precision applies equally to both cases.
