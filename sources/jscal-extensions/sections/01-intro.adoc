== Introduction

The JSCalendar <<RFC8984>> format aims to be an alternative to the iCalendar <<RFC5545>> format
for representation of calendar data. As such, it introduces new semantics that are not covered
in the current definition of iCalendar and its extensions. Converting calendar data between the
two formats is defined in <<ref-jscalendar-icalendar>> with the goal of not loosing any
semantics during conversion. In order to do so, this document defines a new set of properties
for iCalendar and extends existing definitions.

=== Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
as described in BCP 14 <<RFC2119>> <<RFC8174>> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
as shown here.
