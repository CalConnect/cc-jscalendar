//This document defines a data model for calendar event and task objects, or groups of such
//objects, in electronic calendar applications and systems. It also defines a JSON representation
//of this data model, which can be used for storage and data exchange in a calendaring and
//scheduling environment.

//The data model is designed to be unambiguous, extendable and simple to process, addressing many
//of the issues found in current calendar data formats like iCalendar.
