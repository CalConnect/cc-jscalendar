[abstract]
== Abstract

This specification defines a data model and JSON representation of calendar data
that can be used for storage and data exchange in a calendaring and scheduling
environment. It aims to be an alternative and, over time, successor to the
widely deployed iCalendar data format. It also aims to be unambiguous,
extendable, and simple to process. In contrast to the jCal format, which is also
based on JSON, JSCalendar is not a direct mapping from iCalendar but defines the
data model independently and expands semantics where appropriate. This
specification obsoletes <<RFC8984>>.
