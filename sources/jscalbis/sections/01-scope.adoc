== Scope

//This document defines a data model and JSON representation of calendar data that can be used for
//storage and data exchange in a calendaring and scheduling environment. It aims to be an
//alternative and, over time, successor to the widely deployed iCalendar data format. It also aims
//to be unambiguous, extendable, and simple to process.

//The format is designed to be a standalone format that can be used independently of any existing
//calendar ecosystem, while still maintaining compatibility with the iCalendar data format to
//facilitate migration and interoperability.

//This document defines:

//* A data model for calendar objects including events, tasks, and groups
//* A JSON representation of this data model
//* Semantics and rules for interpreting and processing calendar data
//* Extensions mechanisms for adding new properties and values
